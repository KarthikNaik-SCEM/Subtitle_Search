00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:15,670
Hello.

2
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:17,190
How are you?

3
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:18,710
All good?

4
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:21,260
Congratulations to all the winners.

5
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:22,430
Super, super proud.

6
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:23,750
I'm nobody to tell this.

7
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:27,270
But thank you so much for all your hard work.

8
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:29,130
And I'm so glad to be here.

9
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:32,340
Thank you so much for all of you inviting
me.

10
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:34,760
Thank you, means a lot.

11
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:42,100
So I had one speech prepared for the gathering,
but I don't know if somewhere someone had

12
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:46,970
told me you have to tell your, you know, life
story.

13
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:47,970
Anyway.

14
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:52,400
So I don't think my life story is good enough
for this gathering.

15
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:58,620
So what I'm going to do is it's called SHE
Empowerment.

16
00:00:58,620 --> 00:00:59,900
Where do I start?

17
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:00,900
Okay.

18
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:09,580
So, generally, I've been called, you know,
"the smiling Queen," or something they say

19
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:13,960
out there, but is it too loud? should I?

20
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:15,040
Is it fine?

21
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,040
Okay.

22
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,040
Okay.

23
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,530
So yeah, like I was saying, I always been
called "the smiling Queen."

24
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:26,620
And I, yes, of course, I always, always keep
smiling.

25
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:34,050
For all the love I get for all the appreciation
I get from all of you who watch my films.

26
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:39,030
But you know, one of the other reasons why
I smile?

27
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:45,299
All of us, I'm pretty sure that all the girls
here, smile through the sadness, through the

28
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:50,720
loneliness, through the anger, through the
frustration, smile is a superpower, you know.

29
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,240
Yeah, same thing with me.

30
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:59,409
I keep doing it, and one day, I keep thinking,
I'll keep smiling till that day where my smile

31
00:01:59,409 --> 00:02:02,420
turns into a real one from the heart.

32
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:05,000
But yes, this is a superpower.

33
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,229
And that's why women are, I think, the most
pure.

34
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:15,819
I don't know, I don't know how to say the
mother is a purest being in the whole world

35
00:02:15,819 --> 00:02:17,629
is what they say, right?

36
00:02:17,629 --> 00:02:18,629
Yeah.

37
00:02:18,629 --> 00:02:21,060
I'm so glad to be born a girl.

38
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:25,590
I'm so glad to be born a girl in this generation.

39
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:30,709
Having such people protect us with all that
they've got.

40
00:02:30,709 --> 00:02:31,709
I don't know.

41
00:02:31,709 --> 00:02:36,819
I'm just super glad, super proud, and yeah,
well.

42
00:02:36,819 --> 00:02:40,069
So let me just start introducing myself.

43
00:02:40,069 --> 00:02:41,489
I'm Rashmika.

44
00:02:41,489 --> 00:02:44,499
For all those who know me a big, big Hi!

45
00:02:44,499 --> 00:02:51,359
And for all those who don't well, I'm an actor
in the southern industry, and I hope soon

46
00:02:51,359 --> 00:02:53,540
you all get to know me as well.

47
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:54,569
That's for my introduction.

48
00:02:54,569 --> 00:02:57,579
I don't think I should go on more on that.

49
00:02:57,579 --> 00:03:06,299
Well, since I was a really small girl, I still
remember all that my mother said was you should

50
00:03:06,299 --> 00:03:14,049
never let someone else see you angry, see
you cry, see you feel any of the negative

51
00:03:14,049 --> 00:03:20,310
emotions because apparently, that's, that's
showing your weakness, right?

52
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:21,920
That's what my mom has always told me.

53
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:27,909
And I think that's one of the reasons why
I just don't know what else to do now.

54
00:03:27,909 --> 00:03:31,360
I actually genuinely do not know how to cry.

55
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,370
Do you know that?

56
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:37,940
Like, I have to work so hard to actually cry
on screen, I cannot do it.

57
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:42,139
And I look like an idiot when I cry on stage.

58
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:44,739
I mean cry on screen, I'm sorry.

59
00:03:44,739 --> 00:03:49,180
So yeah, I think that is the one thing I can't
do.

60
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:55,519
But I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
what to say nowadays I see women doing so

61
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:57,069
many things.

62
00:03:57,069 --> 00:04:01,609
Women accomplishing so many things in different
fields.

63
00:04:01,609 --> 00:04:03,189
And I feel too little.

64
00:04:03,189 --> 00:04:05,739
I feel like, what am I doing?

65
00:04:05,739 --> 00:04:06,739
I don't know.

66
00:04:06,739 --> 00:04:08,499
Is it good enough?

67
00:04:08,499 --> 00:04:14,110
Is it enough for me to get all of this love
and appreciation for something so small that

68
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:15,139
I'm doing?

69
00:04:15,139 --> 00:04:16,139
I don't know.

70
00:04:16,139 --> 00:04:17,139
I don't.

71
00:04:17,139 --> 00:04:21,779
I still feel like this is not enough, and
I want to do a lot more.

72
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:30,840
And well, I'm just a girl from a small town
in Karnataka called Virajpet in Kodagu district.

73
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:33,500
I don't know if you guys are aware of it.

74
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:36,230
From there I don't know how my life has happened.

75
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:40,780
I don't know at the age of 23; I'm here talking
to such a gathering.

76
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:47,150
But I'm, I'm glad that I am, and I don't know
if I want to say that I'm proud of myself

77
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:51,250
yet because I don't think I'm done yet.

78
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:59,790
I've just started, and I feel like I'm in
the process of getting myself a huge, big

79
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:03,100
loving kingdom that I'm going to create for
myself.

80
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:12,500
And why I started saying this is if I, a girl
from Kodagu, can do this then imagine you

81
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:16,910
guys from Hyderabad what you're capable of.

82
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:23,510
I think women are capable of doing anything
they want in this world.

83
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:27,670
And I hope one day all of you make your dreams
come true.

84
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:29,120
Please dream big.

85
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,760
I'm sorry if the speech is too boring.

86
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:38,660
But I just want to say, dream big, do not
give a break, keep working hard, keep working

87
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:39,660
hard.

88
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:42,060
It's okay if someone is laughing at you.

89
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:46,970
It's okay if someone is pulling your leg,
pulling you back down, it's okay.

90
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:48,570
You just keep working hard.

91
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:55,010
You just keep looking up at the sky and reach
your goals no matter what anyone else says.

92
00:05:55,010 --> 00:06:00,600
Because if you cannot protect yourself and
dream for yourself, nobody else can.

93
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,880
Truly, trust me.

94
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:03,880
I've been there.

95
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:07,720
I've done that, and now I'm in the process
of getting there, and I think I will get there

96
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,210
pretty soon.

97
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:16,360
I hope all of you join me and thank you so
much for doing such a wonderful program like

98
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,890
this and having me as a part of it.

99
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:23,890
Means a lot, feel really, I'm truly grateful
honestly.

100
00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:27,010
Thank you so much, and sorry if I have bored
you.

101
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:33,590
But I just wanted to say we are here to protect
you, and I hope you reach your dreams you

102
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:35,140
make your dreams come true.

103
00:06:35,140 --> 00:07:06,890
Thank you.
